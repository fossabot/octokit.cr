# Octokit
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwatzon%2Foctokit.cr.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwatzon%2Foctokit.cr?ref=badge_shield)


Crystal toolkit for the GitHub API.

**Note:** This is in the very early stages of development. The GitHub API is expansive and there is a lot to do to get this up and running. For a list of API connections that have been completed and are still to come, see the [Roadmap](#roadmap)

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
 octokit:
   github: watzon/octokit
```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "octokit"

# Create a new Octokit Client
github = Octokit::Client.new("watzon", "PASSWORD")

# Fetch information about the logged in user
pp github.user

# Fetch information about another user
pp github.user("asterite")
```

There are way too many options to list here, even at this early stage. For more usage examples see the [documentation](https://watzon.github.io/octokit.cr/).

## Roadmap

There are a lot of pieces of the GitHub API to cover. Here are the ones that need to be working before this shard is considered v1.0 ready.

I am trying to complete what I deem the most important ones first so that this shard can be immediately useful. Keep in mind, however, that the API may change at any time.
